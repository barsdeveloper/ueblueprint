# UEBlueprint

A stand alone editor implementation of the Unreal Engine's Blueprint visual language. (WIP)

## Features:

- Intercommunicates with UE (can copy nodes both ways).
- Can be used as a WEB library to visualize, interact and modify Blueprint graphs.
- Can be used inside VS Code to operate directly on files from a UE project (in the future).
- Graph shown is pixel-similar to how it appears in UE.
- Graph behaves the same way as it does in UE (with the default settings).
- All the information shown in he graph is just the one embedded in the serialized text (in VS Code it should be able to access assets also).
- Modern object oriented, clean, JavaScript codebase.

## How to use:
